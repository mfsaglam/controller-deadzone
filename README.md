# Controller Deadzone

Controller deadzone is the amount your control stick can move before itâ€™s recognized in game. The bigger the deadzone the more the stick can move before it registers an input. A low deadzone is more responsive, a subtle touch will result in an input, on the flip side, if your controller is a little worn or the sticks are a little loose it could lead to drift. Larger deadzones trade off slower responsiveness to avoid accidental inputs.
